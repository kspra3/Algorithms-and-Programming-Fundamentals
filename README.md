# Algorithms and Programming Fundamentals

## Workshop 1
#### DegToRad.py
Convert a decimal value from Degrees to Radians. 
Print out cosine of this angle.
#### Sum.py
Program to add two numbers and print them.
#### TempConv.py
The conversion from F degrees Fahrenheit to C degrees Celsius.

## Workshop 2
#### AvgList.py
Calculate the average of a list of numbers, received one at a time.
#### CoinToss.py
Write a program that takes a number n as input from the user and simulates n coin flips and print the total number of heads and the total number of tails. Calculate the ratio of heads to the total coin flips.

## Workshop 3
#### ListToTable.py
List of Lists, Tables and References. Write a program that asks user to input 5 lines of numbers. Your program should represent these lines as a table.
```
For example:
Enter some numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 
Enter some numbers: 5 6 7 8 9
Enter some numbers: 1 1 1 1 1
Enter some numbers: 1 5 6 7 2 
Enter some numbers: 0 0 0 0 0
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 5, 6, 7, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

## Workshop 4
#### GraphAdjList.py
One way of storing a graph is as an adjacency list, that is, for each vertex we store a list of vertices adjacent to it. For this task you can assume the vertices are numbered 0,1,2,...,n−1 where n ≥ 1. Write a program that takes as input the number of vertices, n, and the name of a file containing an edge list representing a graph. Each line of the file has exactly one edge represented by 2 vertices.Your program should read an edge list from the file and store it as an adjacency list. It should print the adjacency list, so that you can check that you have read the file correctly.
```
For example:
Enter value for n: 4
Enter the filename: testGraph.txt
[[1, 2], [0, 2, 3], [1, 0], [1]]
```
#### GraphAdjMat.py
Another way of storing a graph is as an adjacency matrix, that is, an n × n table A where A[i][ j] = 1 if vertex i is adjacent to vertex j. In this task vertices which represent football teams are numbered 0,1,2,...,n−1, where n is the number of football teams. Two teams are adjacent in the graph, if they have played a match together in 2015. You can assume that two teams played at most one match with each other in 2015. Write a program that takes as input the number of teams, n, and the name of a file containing the edges in the graph. The file is formatted in the same way as the file in the previous tasks. Your program should store the graph as an adjacency matrix. It should print the adjacency matrix, so that you can check that you have read the file correctly.
```
For example:
Enter the number of teams: 4
Enter the filename: testGraph.txt
[[0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,1],[1,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0]]
```
