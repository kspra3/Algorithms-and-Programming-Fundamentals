#### Sum.py
Program to add two numbers and print them.
#### TempConv.py
The conversion from F degrees Fahrenheit to C degrees Celsius.

## Workshop 2
#### AvgList.py
Calculate the average of a list of numbers, received one at a time.
#### CoinToss.py
Write a program that takes a number n as input from the user and simulates n coin flips and print the total number of heads and the total number of tails. Calculate the ratio of heads to the total coin flips.

## Workshop 3
#### ListToTable.py
List of Lists, Tables and References. Write a program that asks user to input 5 lines of numbers. Your program should represent these lines as a table.
```
For example:
Enter some numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 
Enter some numbers: 5 6 7 
Enter some numbers: 1 1 1 1 
Enter some numbers: 1.5 6 7.5 2 
Enter some numbers: 0
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 7], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1.5, 6, 7.5, 2], [0]]
```
